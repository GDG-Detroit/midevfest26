      abstract: 'Who controls materials, controls the future.',
      description: `We talk about AI and software as shaping the future. But every one of those systems depends on physical infrastructure and that infrastructure depends on materials. If we don’t rethink the materials layer, we’re just optimizing systems built on unstable foundations. This talk explores a critical but often overlooked question: who actually controls the inputs that power innovation? As supply chains become more unstable and sustainability requirements reshape industries, materials are emerging as a new point of leverage. Yet most professionals, even in tech, are building on top of systems they didn’t design and don’t control. Drawing from real-world work in circular manufacturing and waste-to-material systems, this session reframes waste as an untapped supply chain and introduces a new way of thinking about infrastructure, decentralization, and local production. Attendees will gain a clearer understanding of how materials shape cost, speed, compliance, and long-term resilience. More importantly, this talk challenges participants to think beyond building products and instead consider how they can influence the systems those products depend on. Because the future isn’t just about what we build. It’s about what we build it from.`,

And more in common than you'd expect. This keynote is not a list of tips. It is not a framework. It is something rarer — three women who have climbed to the highest levels of their fields in energy, technology, and enterprise pulling back the curtain on what the journey actually looked like. The moments that shaped them. The people who showed up — and the ones who didn't. The decisions that required courage they hadn't yet built. And the quiet, determined way they kept moving anyway. Together, they will explore what it means to build a personal board of advisors — the trusted circle that gives honest counsel at 1 o'clock in the morning when a career decision can't wait. They'll talk about what real sponsorship looks like beyond a title or a favor — and what happens when those relationships shift. They'll speak to the experience of being one of the few women of color in the room, and how they learned to navigate hierarchy, bias, and expectations without losing themselves in the process. This is a conversation about courage — speaking up for yourself, speaking up for others, and recognizing the moments when your voice is exactly what someone else needed to hear. You'll leave this session with more than inspiration. You'll leave with a clearer picture of who you are building around you — and who you are becoming for someone else.`,

      description: `You're in a meeting. You look calm. Laptop open, notes ready, nodding at the right moments. What nobody knows is that your chest is tight, you haven't slept properly in days, and the version of you sitting in that chair is running entirely on adrenaline and willpower. You're not resilient. You're surviving. And you've gotten so good at surviving that you've convinced yourself they're the same thing. This interactive session challenges the pattern that keeps high-performing women in tech stuck in ""Resilience Reactor"" mode, always managing, always one step behind their own nervous system, burning capacity faster than they can rebuild it. Instead of another ""self-care"" talk, you'll learn to train resilience like a muscle: as a repeatable, measurable skill that works under real pressure. Guided by the ""Break the Pattern"" theme, this session addresses how women in tech can dismantle the reactive survival patterns that traditional career advice reinforces, hustle harder, be tougher, push through, and build a sustainable resilience system instead. You'll walk away with: - A 60-second reset you can use before your next hard conversation or after a triggering Slack message - Two core resilience pillars (Self-Awareness and Decision Integrity) with reflection prompts to build your personal resilience plan - The Manager Resilience Scorecard to identify your exact growth levers This isn't motivation. It's training. Expect hands-on activities, Mentimeter polls, and a signature mirror exercise that will shift how you see pressure, and yourself, in 60 seconds. Why this matters for Michigan's tech ecosystem: Women in tech face compounding pressures, imposter syndrome, being the only woman in the room, constant context-switching, always-on culture. Building resilience as a trainable skill isn't just personal development, it's how we retain talent, close leadership gaps, and create sustainable paths to innovation.`,

Too often, we rely on inconsistent marketing, word-of-mouth, and guesswork to grow businesses that deserve far more visibility and revenue. In this empowering, hands-on workshop, Tatiana Simone—Chief Culture Strategist and ADDY Award–winning marketing leader—guides women through a new way of building. Rooted in her signature P.R.O.F.I.T Method™, this session shows how to use AI not as a shortcut, but as a tool for clarity, confidence, and control. Participants will learn how to position their ideas, connect with their audience, and create marketing that reflects both their voice and their vision. More importantly, they will walk away with a structured, repeatable system to turn what they know into campaigns that generate real results. Aligned with the spirit of breaking patterns and building new pathways, this workshop is designed for women who are ready to move differently—leveraging technology with intention, owning their expertise, and creating businesses that grow with purpose.`,

Drawing from her work at Dapp Detroit, Ramona will share practical examples of how tools across the Google ecosystem—including Vertex AI, Google Workspace, and related technologies—can be used to build systems that are not only scalable, but also ethical, transparent, and accessible. A key focus of the session is how these same tools can support neurodiverse and 2e individuals by enabling more adaptive and personalized approaches to learning and problem-solving. Key Takeaways: - A practical approach to building ethical AI systems in real-world environments - Examples of how low-code and AI are being applied across enterprise and education Strategies for leveraging Google tools to support inclusive innovation A new perspective on how AI can be used not just to optimize systems, but to expand how people think, build, and contribute.',

      description:
        'True impact in tech - the kind that changes industries like energy, healthcare, and manufacturing -doesn’t just happen at the keyboard. It is nurtured in the spaces where funding is allocated, rears itself where hiring standards are set, and leaves deep marks as credit, attribution, or kudos are given. Most of us know how to deliver. We lead projects, solve problems, maintain critical systems, and get results. But we don’t always ask: Who is actually deciding what gets built? Who is in the room when funding gets allocated? Who is shaping the future vectors for organizations and industries? Join us for a panel featuring four women working across manufacturing, aerospace, enterprise software, AI, and STEM education who have navigated with influence inside complex organizations. Enter a practical discussion that arcs from delivering results to shaping direction and what that shift actually requires from a twenty-first century woman in tech.
