# Contributing to the Detroit Pride Innovation Summit Website

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Detroit Pride Innovation Summit (`pridemi26`)! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or higher
- npm
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pridemi26.git
   cd pridemi26
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### GitHub Desktop: Push/PR goes to wrong org or repo

If **Push** or **Create Pull Request** in GitHub Desktop opens or targets a different organization or repository:

1. **Re-add the repo** so GitHub Desktop picks up the correct remote:

   - In GitHub Desktop: **File → Remove repository** (removes it from the list only; files stay on disk).
   - **File → Add Local Repository** and choose this project folder (`pridemi26`).
   - GitHub Desktop will use the existing Git remotes; pushes and "Create Pull Request" should now target **Compass-Detroit/pridemi26**.

2. **Confirm remotes in Terminal** (optional):
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see `origin` (and optionally `upstream`) pointing to `https://github.com/Compass-Detroit/pridemi26.git`. If not:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Compass-Detroit/pridemi26.git
   ```
   Then remove and re-add the repo in GitHub Desktop as in step 1.

## Code Quality Standards

### Automated Checks

All pull requests are automatically checked for:

- **Code Quality**: ESLint checks for code style and potential errors
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier ensures consistent code formatting
- **Build Verification**: Ensures the application builds successfully
- **Accessibility**: Automated accessibility testing with axe-core against the built site
- **Security**: npm audit checks for security vulnerabilities

### Manual Checks

Before submitting a PR, please ensure:

- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards
- [ ] All automated checks pass
- [ ] Code is properly commented where necessary
- [ ] No console.log statements left in the code
- [ ] Error handling is implemented where appropriate

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test your changes locally

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Run accessibility linting
npm run lint:a11y

# Build the application
npm run build
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We use conventional commits. Your commit message should follow this format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(speakers): add speaker bio modal"
git commit -m "fix(navbar): resolve mobile menu accessibility issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub using our PR template.

### Testing Accessibility

```bash
# Lint JSX for accessibility issues (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)
npm run lint:a11y

# Run the full accessibility check (a11y lint + build)
npm run a11y:check
```

## Code Style Guidelines
